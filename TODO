Add support for prelexed
	%type shall be used to match against a lexical type.

	Some languages may require (or at least it would helpful)
	context handling during parsing. For this, rule should
	be annotatable to add hooks to the parser, these will be
	place before the rule name: @open(function-name) should
	call function-name at the beginning of the rule, and
	@close(function-name) should call function-name at the
	end of the rule. When the parser decides that it took
	the wrong path, it will check if either function has
	added all callback function for when the node is retracted,
	and if so call that function. The two former hooks shall
	also be able to call the parser to commit to the path
	it's on, which will cause the parser to fall if it needs
	to backtrack bejoined that point, this will also allow
	the application to take action on parsed rules and
	deallocate memory that is no longer needed after that.
	The hooks shall also be able to cause the parser to abort.

Add tests
